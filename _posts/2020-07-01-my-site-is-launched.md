<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>It's taken quite a long time, but I've pulled my finger out and got a small website put together. However basic, I've wanted something which I've created entirely from scratch, and feels quite lightweight, too. Voila.</p> 

<p>I've wanted to set something up like this from scratch for a while.</p>

<p>I've only done it now, maybe, as a reaction to my current working sitatuion, which is working from home permanently until September at least.</p>

<p>As a designer, I believe one of my strongest traits should be to communicate thoughts and ideas pretty efficiently and succintly to a wide range of audiences. People in the know. People not in the know. I'm pretty rubbish at this. Peers might tell me otherwise, but I can't help but feel it.</p>

<p>Test to see if this is working</p>
