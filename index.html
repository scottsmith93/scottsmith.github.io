	<h1>I'm Scott.</h1>
	<h2>I'm an Interaction Designer at the NHS BSA in Newcastle.</h2>
	<p>This is a new site I've created, in an attempt to better my writing abilities and to pencil the many thoughts that run through my head. This is also a WIP.</p>
	<p>If you read something and it resonates, or if you disagree with something, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
